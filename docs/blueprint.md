## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#121212), almost black, for a sophisticated, modern feel, and to ensure perfect contrast with white text.
- Primary color: Pure white (#FFFFFF) for typography, creating maximum contrast on the dark background. Avoid shades of gray.
- Accent color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to provide subtle visual separation for less important elements like the project heading.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif for headlines. To match the inspirational image as closely as possible.
- Body font: 'Inter', a versatile sans-serif to clearly explain project information
- Full-screen layout with content vertically centered to emphasize the key message. All components must vertically span the viewport. In the optional AI tool, there must be extra components, or popups, which shouldn't adhere to these full-screen properties.
