- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF4), slightly desaturated from the primary, providing a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted blue (#81A1C1), analogous to the primary but lighter, to highlight key interactive elements and sections.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use simple, consistent icons in a similar style to the original site, focusing on clarity and easy recognition. The weight of strokes should be uniform across all icons.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#121212), almost black, for a sophisticated, modern feel, and to ensure perfect contrast with white text.
- Primary color: Pure white (#FFFFFF) for typography, creating maximum contrast on the dark background. Avoid shades of gray.
- Accent color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to provide subtle visual separation for less important elements like the project heading.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif for headlines. To match the inspirational image as closely as possible.
- Body font: 'Inter', a versatile sans-serif to clearly explain project information
- Full-screen layout with content vertically centered to emphasize the key message. All components must vertically span the viewport. In the optional AI tool, there must be extra components, or popups, which shouldn't adhere to these full-screen properties.
